# General Introduction

This lesson aims to familiarise you with the toolsuite _Loghi_ by walking you through the steps of using its various functions. 

Most of the material is intended as "type-along", i.e. you are encouraged to try out the presented commands on your own computer. In order to follow along, please ensure that you have installed all the pre-requisites, and have downloaded and unzipped the lesson material. 

If you have your own data that you would like to use instead, please ensure the following:
- each image and its corresponding transcription share the same name (with different file extensions), e.g.:
  - the transcription file1.xml belongs to the digital image file1.png 
- transcriptions are stored in PAGE XML
- all images are stored in the same folder (with a name of your choice)
- a folder called "page", stored within the image folder, containing all of the PAGE XML transcriptions

## Scenario
This lesson is based on the following scenario: 

> From a previous project on (Norwegian) handwritten documents, we have a collection of digital images and corresponding transcriptions, written by [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen). This data has been used to train a deep-learning-based handwritten text recognition model. 

> We have acquired new documents, written by [Kristine Bonnevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristine_Bonnevie), for which no transcriptions exist yet. In order to reduce the amount of manual transcription work, we want to leverage the previously trained model, aiming to obtain sufficiently precise transcriptions of the new material.
