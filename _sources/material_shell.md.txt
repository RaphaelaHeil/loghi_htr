## Opening a Shell

### Linux
In the applications menu or the search bar, look for a programme called `Terminal`, or press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`. 

### MacOs
Search for `Terminal` in the Mac `Spotlight` search function. Alternatively, in `Finder`, select the `Go` menu, then select `Utilities`, and locate and open the `Terminal` from there. 

### Windows
Look for the `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell` in the Windows start menu. Type `wsl` and press `Enter`.

```{note}
When you interact with the WSL for the first time via the shell, you will be prompted to choose a username and password. Enter (and memorise) values of your choice and press `Enter`.
